# Salary-Prediction-Polynomial-Regression

This ML model will predict the previous salary of an interview candidate using linear regression and polynomial linear regression (degree 2,3,4) with visualisation
in order to understand the difference between linear regression and polynomial linear regression.

Data set Explanation:
Given data set consistes of 10x3 values
Columns
 Position- Position of an employee in the previous company
 Level - Level of an employee in the previous company
 Salary - Salary for an employee based position and level
 
 Since the salary of the employee can be greater than that as specified in the dataset due to appraisals, we aim to predict the salary of the candidate with level as 6.5
 using both linear regression and polynomial linear regression and differentiate the results.
 
 Since the aim of this repository is to differentiate linear regression and polynomial linear regression, we use only 10 rows.
 So it is not necessary to split the dataset into train and test data set.
