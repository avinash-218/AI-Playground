# Homer-Bart-Classification-ANN-Feature-Extraction-CNN-Transfer-Learning

This repository aims to differentiate image classfication of Homer and Bart
by using:
- Artificial Neural Networks
- Artificial Neural Networks (Feature Extraction)
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Transfer Learning (Additional)

## Summary of Differences :
### 1) ANN
- Training time : Very High
- Space occupied by Weights : Around 25 GB.
- Accuracy is lesser compared to that of feature extractions.

### 2) ANN Feature Extraction based on colors
- Training time : Lesser than ANN
- Space occupied by Weights : Few Kilobytes.
- Accuracy is better compared to that of ANN without feature extraction.

### 3) CNN
- Training time : Lesser than ANN with feature extraction
- Space occupied by Weights : Few Kilobytes.
- Accuracy is better compared to that of ANN with feature extraction.

Summary, CNN is the best for image classification
