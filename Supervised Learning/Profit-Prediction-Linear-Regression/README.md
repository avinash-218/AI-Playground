# Profit-Prediction-Linear-Regression
The data sets are taken from coursera's Machine Learning Course.

In this, you will implement linear regression to predict profits 
for a food truck. Suppose you are the CEO of a
restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new
outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for
profits and populations from the cities.

You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand
to next.The first column is the population of a city and the second column is
the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a
loss.
